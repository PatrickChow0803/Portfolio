Hello, I'm Patrick. I'm a Flutter/Android Developer with over 5 years of programming experience. I have a Computer Science Degree from Brooklyn College. My best languages are Dart and Kotlin.

I love technology and software, especially for smartphones. This love is what sparked me to specialize in creating apps with the use of Flutter and Native Android.

All of my contact info are in the left side menu.
